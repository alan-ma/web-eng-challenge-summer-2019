why vue?
    require framework for dynamic data
    lightweight and fast for this purpose, not as overloaded as other ones

challenges/points of note:
    filter algorithm: take in string, split by spaces for keyword list
        check title and keywords to see if they include all keywords
        this runs in linear time, which would not scale well
        for the purposes of this application (~1000 entries) and time of implementation, it runs well
    
    data retrieved from API:
        there wasn't an API so I opted to retrieve the entire set of data on loading of the application
        the descriptions were trasferred as safe text, so it had to be parsed
            the process utilized the browser's rendering engine, it may be unsafe if the API returns unsafe HTML

        but it was the best solution that didn't include preprocessing an offline version
